                <h1 class="section-title">What <span class="pBorder">is</span> Naughty Dog?</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Gamers today know Naughty Dog like movie-goers know Spielberg and Scorsese, 
                        and there's a reason for that. The minds there continuously make some of the 
                        industry's best games, ones that push the boundaries of graphical fidelity and 
                        storytelling in particular.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, if you still don't know what Naughty Dog is (how did you even get here?), 
                        Naughty Dog, LLC (formerly JAM Software, Inc.) is an American first-party video 
                        game developer based in Santa Monica, California. Founded by Andy Gavin and 
                        Jason Rubin in 1984, the studio was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2001.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the mid-to-late '90s, the studio was best-known for Crash Bandicoot, but as time has 
                        gone on -- and since it joined Sony's first party stable -- Naughty Dog's drive to create 
                        the best mascot platformers, like Jak & Daxter, has evolved into some of the most stunningly 
                        realistic and engaging story-driven action titles of the last few generations in the form of 
                        the Uncharted series and The Last of Us duology.
